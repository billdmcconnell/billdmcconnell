- 👋 Hi, I’m @billdmcconnell, Bill McConnell
- 👀 I’m interested in county level data analysis.  I got started with COVID data on gitHub, but I can see potential for lots of interesting analysis.  This is hobby for me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to access census data
- 💞️ I will consider collaborating on related topics, including data queries, awk and bash tools for data extraction and management
- 📫 How to reach me work@billdmcconnell.com
